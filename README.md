MOD features:

**Improved scrap smelting for Tier I and II blast furnaces (reduced coal consumption and lower exhaust emissions); both must be researched.
**Solar thermal steam (water to depleted steam) and steam compressor with two recipes 
(depleted steam to low steam + water, and low steam to high steam + depleted steam). 
The steam compressor currently uses the Tier 1 liquid storage graphics. 
The solar thermal steam generator already has a new 3D model and icon included.
